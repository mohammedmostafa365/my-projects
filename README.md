**Sonar Rock vs Mine Classification**

**Overview**

This project uses Sonar data to classify whether an object is a rock or a mine based on sonar signal readings.
It applies Logistic Regression for binary classification.

**Dataset**

-Total samples: 208

-Features: 60 numerical readings per sample

-Target: R (Rock) or M (Mine)

**Steps Performed**

-Imported libraries

-Loaded and explored the dataset

-Split data into training and test sets (90% training, 10% testing)

-Trained a Logistic Regression model

-Evaluated accuracy on training and test data

-Predicted on random test samples

**Model Performance**

-Training accuracy: 83.4%

-Test accuracy: 76.2%

**How to Run**

-Download or clone the repository

-Make sure the required libraries are installed

-Open the project in a Python IDE or Jupyter Notebook

-Run the notebook or script to see the results

**Requirements**

-Python 3.8+

-numpy

-pandas

-scikit-learn

**Future Improvements**

-Try other algorithms like Random Forest or SVM

-Apply feature scaling or PCA

-Use cross-validation for better performance estimation
